Build a React + Firebase web application for “The Atlas Exports”, a B2B export company based in Punjab, India, focused on:

Agriculture equipment

Agro commodities (starting with rice)

The app should have:

Public website

Client portal (no login)

Admin portal (with authentication)

Focus mainly on the following PRODUCT and CONTENT requirements:

Product categories and structure

Create two main product categories:

Category A: Agriculture Equipments
Example products under this:

Hydraulic Disc Harrow

Mould Board Plough

Disc Plough

Reversible Mould Board Plough

Cultivator

Other equipment (ability to add more later through admin)

Category B: Agro Commodities
Example products under this:

Rice (e.g., Premium Basmati Rice)

Other agro commodities (ability to add more later through admin)

For each product, store and manage:

Title (string)

Category (reference to Agriculture Equipments or Agro Commodities)

Description (short marketing description, 2–4 lines)

Specifications (either a multi-line text or structured key–value data, e.g.:

For equipment: width, weight, tractor HP range, material, usage, etc.

For rice: grain type, length, moisture %, purity %, packaging, origin, etc.)

Multiple image URLs (array of strings)

Active/inactive flag (for hiding products without deleting)

Created/updated timestamps

The public site should show:

A “Products” section or page where:

Users can filter or switch between:

Agriculture Equipments

Agro Commodities

Each product appears as a card with:

Image

Title

Category tag

1–2 line description

“View Details” or “Request Quote” button

A product detail view that shows:

All images (gallery)

Full description

Specifications in a clean layout (like a list or table)

A “Request Quote / Enquiry” form or button

The admin portal must support full CRUD for:

Product categories

Products themselves (including images, specs, description, active flag)

Client portal (no login) – content requirements

Create a client-facing portal page (no authentication required) with:

“Our Clients” section:

List of client names or company names and optionally country/region.

Ability (via admin) to add/edit/remove client entries.

Display them in a grid or list.

Reviews / Testimonials:

Public list of approved reviews with:

Client name

Company

Rating (1–5 stars)

Short comment

“Add Review” form with fields:

Name

Email

Company

Rating (1–5)

Comment

On submit:

Store the review as “pending” (not visible publicly until admin approval).

Contact us:

Contact form for potential buyers:

Name

Email

Company

Message (and optionally subject/purpose)

On submit:

Store submission in database

Send email notification to the site owner / client

Social links:

Show working links for:

WhatsApp

LinkedIn

Instagram

Any other social profiles

These URLs should be editable via admin so the client can change them later.

Additionally, the client portal should be a central “engagement” page where:

Button clicks and important interactions (add review, submit contact form, click social icons) can be stored as events for analytics (e.g., event type, page, timestamp).

Admin portal – product and content management

Implement an admin area (protected by login) with the following capabilities:

a) Authentication

Simple email/password login for admin.

Only authenticated admin can access admin routes.

b) Product categories management

View list of categories (e.g., Agriculture Equipments, Agro Commodities).

Add new category (name, type, status).

Edit existing category.

Delete category.

Toggle active/inactive.

c) Product management (CRUD)

View list of products with:

Title

Category

Active/inactive status

Filter products by category.

Add new product with fields:

Category selection

Title

Description

Specifications (text area or structured)

Multiple image URLs

Active/inactive toggle

Edit product (all fields).

Delete product (soft delete or mark as inactive is fine).

d) Content sections management
Admin must be able to edit the main informational sections:

About Us

Our Mission

Our Vision

Why Choose Us

Founders / Our Team

Our Clients intro text

Any hero/intro text used on the public home page or client portal

This can be done with simple textareas or a basic rich text editor. Store this content in a “sections” collection so the public pages read from it.

e) Reviews management

View all reviews from client portal:

Filter by Approved / Pending

Approve a pending review (makes it visible on client portal).

Reject/delete a review.

Optional: edit a review comment before approving.

f) Contact submissions

View all contact submissions sent from public site and client portal.

Show:

Name

Email

Company

Message

Date/time

Ability to mark each submission as read/unread.

Optional: delete submissions.

g) Basic analytics (events)
(Keep it simple, MVP-level.)

Store events (page views, button clicks, form submissions, social clicks) in a collection with:

type (page_view, button_click, form_submit, social_click)

page (e.g., “home”, “products”, “client-portal”)

details (e.g., which button, which social, which product)

timestamp

In admin dashboard, show:

Counts of:

Total events

Total contact form submissions

Total reviews submitted

Simple list of recent events (no need for complex charts in MVP unless easy).

Public site content structure (non-style requirements)

Public site should include:

Home:

Hero section with main heading about exporting rice and agricultural equipment from Punjab.

Short subheading about trust, quality, and long-term partnerships.

CTA buttons:

View Products

Visit Client Portal or Contact

Products:

Structured by the two categories above.

Product cards and details as described.

About:

Based on the supplied About, Mission, Vision, Why Choose Us, Founders, and Clients content.

All text should be editable from admin as noted.

Contact:

Contact form and basic company info (location Punjab, India, email, phone, business hours).

Form submissions stored and visible in admin.
